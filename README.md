## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project gave me hands-on experience with:

- Managing **active states** for rating buttons
- Using `addEventListener` for click and
- Updating the DOM dynamically with JavaScript (`textContent`, `classList`)
- Toggling components (rating screen → thank you screen)
- Handling edge cases (e.g., no rating selected on submit)

### Continued development

For future improvements, I’d like to:

- Add keyboard navigation for better accessibility
- Smooth animations when switching screens
